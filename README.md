# PokéHunt Discord

This is the code for the official PokéHunt Discord Bot.

## How to run the Discord bot

Note that you need an API key to access the PokéHunt API, which you can not do (yet)

Download the file `compose.yml` from [here](https://github.com/pokehunt-xyz/discord/blob/main/compose.yml) and edit the environment variables.

After that run the following command:

```
docker compose up -d
```
